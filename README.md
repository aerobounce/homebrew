# homebrew-mpv-build
Customized formula of mpv. Build only (no bottles).

# Install

- `brew install --HEAD aerobounce/mpv-HEAD/mpv`

# Why
- mpv formula has been removed from homebrew-core.
- https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/commit/41444d526c40b93069b7f0c5414539deb0534179

----

- As of https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv/commit/3a8abbee2fd25f9d137098cd4ed9f7cedf478fbd, v0.30.0 has been released. Hopefully this makes mpv back to vanilla brew core repository. However, I will keep maintain this repository for a personal experiment.
- building mpv is quite lightweight than you think, anyway.
